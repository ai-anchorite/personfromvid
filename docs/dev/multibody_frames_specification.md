# Feature Specification: Multi-Person Frame Representation

## 1. Overview

**Feature:** Per-Frame `Person` Domain Object  
**Work Category:** Foundational Data-Model Refactor

### 1.1. Problem Statement

The current video analysis pipeline processes faces, body poses, and head poses as independent, disconnected detections within a single frame. The core logic assumes a one-to-one correspondence based on list indices (e.g., `face_detections[i]` belongs to `pose_detections[i]`). This assumption breaks down in multi-person scenarios, leading to incorrect associations and limiting output to a single, often arbitrary, person's crop per frame.

To address these limitations, this specification proposes the introduction of a first-class, frame-scoped `Person` entity. This new data object will:

1.  **Unify Detections:** Reliably link a detected face to its corresponding body pose within a frame.
2.  **Enable Advanced Selection:** Expose a unified "person quality" score to improve the frame and subject selection logic.
3.  **Provide a Foundation for Tracking:** Establish a forward-compatible data schema that can support future cross-frame person tracking, without implementing tracking at this stage.

### 1.2. Success Criteria

The feature will be considered successfully implemented when:
*   Each frame produces a list of zero or more `Person` objects, one for each recognizable individual.
*   Faces and body poses are associated with high accuracy (≥95% on a standard evaluation set) using a deterministic algorithm.
*   A `Person.quality` score, calculated as a weighted average of face and body quality (`0.7 * FaceQuality + 0.3 * BodyQuality`), is available for each person and persisted in the final JSON output.
*   The entire pipeline and all associated tests pass successfully with the new data model, with no legacy support for the old schema.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Functional Requirements

- **`Person` Data Model:** Introduce a `Person` dataclass in a new `personfromvid/data/person.py` module. It must contain the following fields:
  - `person_id: int`: A zero-based index identifying the person within the frame, ordered from left to right based on the horizontal position of the body's bounding box.
  - `face: FaceDetection | FaceUnknown`: The associated face detection. `FaceUnknown` is a singleton sentinel object used when a face is not detected for a given person.
  - `body: PoseDetection | BodyUnknown`: The associated body pose detection. `BodyUnknown` is a singleton sentinel object used when a body is not detected.
  - `head_pose: Optional[HeadPoseResult]`: The head pose, linked via the face detection's ID.
  - `quality: PersonQuality`: A composite quality score object.

- **`Person` Instantiation:** `Person` objects are constructed by a new association algorithm. A `Person` can be created if at least one primary detection (face or body) is present.

- **Quality Scoring:** A new `PersonQuality` object will be computed, defined by the formula: `0.7 * FaceQuality + 0.3 * BodyQuality`. If a face or body is missing, its quality score is treated as `0.0` in the calculation.

- **Data Access:** The `FrameData` object will expose a clean API for accessing the list of people detected in the frame:
  - `FrameData.get_persons() -> List[Person]`

- **Person-Based Selection:** Implement individual person selection using positional identity to ensure comprehensive representation of all detected persons. This includes:
  - **Positional Identity:** Group persons by their `person_id` (left-to-right ordering within frames) to provide naive cross-frame person tracking.
  - **Quality-First Selection:** Within each person_id group, select the highest quality instances up to configured minimum and maximum counts.
  - **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure all detected person positions (person_0, person_1, person_2, etc.) receive representation in the final output.

### 2.2. Technical Constraints

- **Schema Evolution:** The project will adopt the new `Person`-centric schema across the entire pipeline. No backward compatibility for the old, index-based association logic will be maintained.

- **Association Algorithm:** Face-to-body association must be deterministic and computationally efficient. The proposed method is a two-pass approach:
  1.  **Pass 1: Spatial Proximity Matching:** The primary strategy is a greedy algorithm based on geometric containment. It iterates through all possible face-body pairs where the face's center point (using `FaceDetection.center` property) is located inside the body's bounding box. The pair with the smallest Euclidean distance between the face center and the body center (using `PoseDetection.center` property) is selected and matched. This process repeats until no more such pairs can be found.
  2.  **Pass 2: Index-Based Fallback:** Any faces and bodies that remain unmatched are sorted independently from left to right based on their x-coordinate. They are then paired by their sorted index. This handles cases where spatial heuristics fail, such as when a face center falls outside the body bounding box (e.g., due to unusual poses or tight cropping).

### 2.3. Edge Cases and Error Handling

- **Partial Detections:**
  - **Face without Body:** A `Person` object will be created with `body=BodyUnknown`.
  - **Body without Face:** A `Person` object will be created with `face=FaceUnknown`.
- **Ambiguous Associations:** Overlapping bodies or faces are handled by the greedy distance-based matching in the spatial association pass. The fallback ensures any remaining items are paired deterministically.
- **Quality Assessor Failure:** If the quality assessor fails for a specific region, a default quality score of `0.0` will be assigned, and the `Person` will be flagged as unusable for high-quality output selection.

---

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1. Implementation Strategy

1.  **Data Layer Foundation (`data/person.py`)**
    - Implement the `Person`, `PersonQuality`, `FaceUnknown`, and `BodyUnknown` classes. The sentinel classes will be singletons inheriting from `FaceDetection` and `PoseDetection` respectively, but with attributes set to default "unknown" values.
    - Extend `FrameData` in `data/frame_data.py` to include `persons: List[Person] = field(default_factory=list)` and the corresponding `get_persons()` helper method.
    - Add `QualityMethod` enum in `data/constants.py` with values `DIRECT` (full-frame analysis) and `INFERRED` (person-derived quality) for quality assessment transparency.

2.  **Association Logic (`analysis/person_builder.py`)**
    - Create a new `PersonBuilder` class responsible for executing the two-pass association algorithm described in **Section 2.2**.
    - This builder will take a `FrameData` object as input, process its `face_detections` and `pose_detections`, and return a list of `Person` objects, sorted left-to-right to assign the final `person_id`.
    
3.  **Pipeline Step (`core/steps/person_building.py`)**
    - Create a new `PersonBuildingStep` class that integrates the `PersonBuilder` into the pipeline.
    - This step will be integrated into `core/pipeline.py` immediately following the pose detection step.
    - **Progress Tracking:** The step will implement comprehensive progress tracking consistent with existing pipeline steps:
      - **Step-level progress:** Track overall person building progress across all frames
      - **Rate calculation:** Display processing rate (frames/second) during person building
      - **Interruption handling:** Check for user interruption at regular intervals
      - **Statistics collection:** Track and display person association statistics (persons found, association success rate, etc.)
      - **Formatter integration:** Support both rich console formatters and basic logging

3.  **Quality Assessment Strategy (`analysis/quality_assessor.py`)**
    - **Inferred Frame Quality**: Frame quality is inferred from person-level assessments using weighted averaging of face/body quality scores (0.7 * face + 0.3 * body). Only frames without persons receive direct full-frame analysis.
    - **Quality Method Tracking**: All `QualityMetrics` include a `method` field (`QualityMethod.INFERRED` for person-derived quality, `QualityMethod.DIRECT` for full-frame analysis) to provide transparency and debugging support.
    - **Performance Optimization**: Eliminates redundant full-frame quality computation for 95%+ of frames while maintaining complete backward compatibility.
    - **Selection Logic**: Both frame-based and person-based selection operate on consistent quality metrics, supporting hybrid selection strategies.

4.  **Serialization (`data/frame_data.py`)**
    - Update `FrameData.to_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods to handle the new `persons` list. The JSON output for each frame will now contain a `persons` array instead of separate `face_detections` and `pose_detections` arrays. Each object in the array will represent a `Person`, nesting the associated face, body, and quality information.

5.  **Downstream Logic Adaptation**
    - **Person Selection (`analysis/person_selector.py` + `core/steps/person_selection.py`):** Create new `PersonSelector` class and `PersonSelectionStep` pipeline step that operates on individual `Person` objects using positional identity for cross-frame grouping. The step will use `person.quality` as the primary metric and select best instances per person_id, storing `PersonSelection` objects in pipeline state.
    - **Backwards Compatibility:** Pipeline will conditionally use either `PersonSelectionStep` or existing `FrameSelectionStep` based on configuration, ensuring zero disruption to existing workflows.
    - **Output Generation (`output/image_writer.py`):** Enhanced to handle both `PersonSelection` objects (new) and frame IDs (existing) for seamless backwards compatibility. The output naming convention in `output/naming_convention.py` has been updated to include comprehensive AI-detected information:
      - **Person ID:** `person_{person_id}` for positional identity
      - **Pose Classification:** Actual pose names (e.g., "standing", "sitting", "walking") extracted from `person.body.pose_classifications`
      - **Head Direction:** Face orientation (e.g., "front", "left", "right") from `person.head_pose.direction`
      - **Shot Type:** Closeup information (e.g., "closeup", "medium", "wide") from frame closeup detections
      - **Enhanced Filename Structure:** `{video}_person_{person_id}_{category}_{head_direction}_{shot_type}_{rank}.{ext}`
      - **Example Filenames:** `sample_video_person_5_standing_front_closeup_001.jpg`

## 4. Pipeline Architecture Changes

### 4.1. Current Pipeline Overview

The existing pipeline operates on a per-frame basis with the following high-level flow:
1. **Frame Extraction** → Extract frames from video
2. **Face Detection** → Detect faces in each frame  
3. **Pose Detection** → Detect body poses in each frame
4. **Head Pose Analysis** → Analyze head orientation for detected faces
5. **Quality Assessment** → Score individual detections
6. **Frame Selection** → Select best frames based on individual detection quality
7. **Output Generation** → Generate crops and metadata

### 4.2. Required Pipeline Modifications

#### 4.2.1. New Pipeline Step: Person Building
**Location:** Between Pose Detection and Quality Assessment  
**Purpose:** Associate faces and bodies into `Person` objects within each frame

```python
# New step integration point
def process_frame(frame_data: FrameData) -> FrameData:
    # ... existing detection steps ...
    frame_data = pose_detection_step.process(frame_data)
    
    # NEW: Person building step
    frame_data = person_building_step.process(frame_data)
    
    # Modified: Quality assessment now operates on Person objects
    frame_data = quality_assessment_step.process(frame_data)
    # ... rest of pipeline ...
```

#### 4.2.2. New Pipeline Step: Person-Based Selection
**Location:** Alternative to existing frame selection step  
**Purpose:** Select individual persons using positional identity and quality ranking

This introduces a **new selection paradigm** alongside existing frame-based selection:

```python
# Existing: Frame-based selection (preserved)
def select_best_frames(frames: List[FrameData]) -> List[str]:
    frame_selector = FrameSelector(config)
    return frame_selector.select_frames(frames)  # Returns frame IDs

# New: Person-based selection (alternative)
def select_best_persons(frames: List[FrameData]) -> List[PersonSelection]:
    person_selector = PersonSelector(config)
    return person_selector.select_best_persons(frames)  # Returns PersonSelection objects
```

**Pipeline Conditional Logic:**
```python
# Pipeline step selection based on configuration
def _initialize_steps(self) -> None:
    selection_step = (PersonSelectionStep if self.config.person_selection.enabled 
                     else FrameSelectionStep)
    
    step_classes = [
        # ... other steps ...
        QualityAssessmentStep,
        selection_step,  # Conditional selection approach
        OutputGenerationStep,
    ]
```

### 4.3. Pipeline Flow Changes

#### 4.3.1. Per-Frame Processing (Modified)
```
Frame → Face Detection → Pose Detection → [NEW] Person Building → Quality Assessment → Frame Storage
```

#### 4.3.2. Cross-Frame Selection (Conditional)
```
# Person-based pipeline (new)
All Processed Frames → [NEW] PersonSelectionStep → Output Generation

# Frame-based pipeline (existing) 
All Processed Frames → [EXISTING] FrameSelectionStep → Output Generation
```

### 4.4. Memory and Performance Implications

#### 4.4.1. Memory Requirements
- **Increased Memory Usage:** All frames must be held in memory for batch diversity selection
- **Mitigation:** Implement frame data compression/serialization for large videos
- **Alternative:** Stream-based processing with sliding window diversity selection

#### 4.4.2. Processing Changes
- **Latency Impact:** No output until all frames are processed (batch vs. streaming)
- **CPU Impact:** Additional person-building step per frame (~2-3% overhead estimated)
- **Per-Person Temporal Filtering:** Additional computational complexity for temporal diversity within each person_id group (expected and acceptable)
- **Quality Assessment Optimization:** Inferred frame quality from person assessments reduces quality computation overhead by 60-80% in multi-person scenarios while maintaining full compatibility
- **I/O Impact:** Potential disk caching for large video processing

#### 4.4.3. Storage Implications
- **Output Multiplication:** Person-based selection may generate significantly more output files than frame-based selection (multiple persons per frame)
- **Storage Scaling:** Storage requirements scale with number of detected persons across frames rather than selected frame count
- **Impact Assessment:** Expected behavior - person-centric output inherently requires more storage for comprehensive person representation

#### 4.4.4. Forward Compatibility Design
- **Quality Method Extensibility:** `QualityMethod` enum supports future assessment strategies (`HYBRID`, `CACHED`, `ML_ENHANCED`, etc.)
- **Seamless Integration:** All downstream code receives consistent `QualityMetrics` objects regardless of computation method
- **Performance Transparency:** Method tracking enables performance analysis and optimization across different quality computation approaches

### 4.5. Implementation Strategy

#### 4.5.1. Backward Compatibility
- **Configuration Flag:** `enable_person_model: bool = True` to toggle new vs. old behavior
- **Gradual Migration:** Support both pipelines during transition period
- **Testing:** Parallel execution for validation during development

#### 4.5.2. Pipeline Step Integration
```python
# New pipeline step interface
class PersonBuildingStep(PipelineStep):
    def process(self, frame_data: FrameData) -> FrameData:
        person_builder = PersonBuilder()
        frame_data.persons = person_builder.build_persons(
            frame_data.face_detections,
            frame_data.pose_detections,
            frame_data.head_poses
        )
        return frame_data

class PersonSelectionStep(PipelineStep):
    def process_batch(self, frames: List[FrameData]) -> List[PersonSelection]:
        person_selector = PersonSelector(self.config)
        return person_selector.select_best_persons(frames)
```

### 4.6. Configuration Impact

New configuration sections required:
```python
@dataclass
class PipelineConfig:
    # Existing config...
    enable_person_model: bool = True
    enable_person_selection: bool = True
    person_building: PersonBuildingConfig = field(default_factory=PersonBuildingConfig)
    person_selection: PersonSelectionCriteria = field(default_factory=PersonSelectionCriteria)
```

## 5. Person-Based Selection Algorithm

### 5.1. Problem Analysis

Traditional frame-based selection approaches face limitations in multi-person scenarios:
- **Inconsistent person representation:** Random selection may miss certain individuals entirely
- **Quality bias toward single-person frames:** Individual person quality in multi-person frames is typically lower
- **Lack of person identity continuity:** No mechanism to ensure comprehensive coverage of all detected persons

The person-based selection approach addresses these issues by ensuring all detected person positions receive representation while prioritizing quality within each person's candidate pool.

### 5.2. Positional Identity Strategy

#### 5.2.1. Constraint Priority Order
Person-based selection follows a **clear priority hierarchy** to resolve conflicts between competing constraints:

1. **PRIORITY 1: Minimum Instance Guarantees** - `min_instances_per_person` is always satisfied when candidates are available, regardless of temporal diversity constraints
2. **PRIORITY 2: Temporal Diversity** - Applied to additional selections beyond the minimum, up to `max_instances_per_person` 
3. **PRIORITY 3: Quality Ranking** - Within each priority level, selections are ordered by `person.quality.overall_quality` (highest first)

This priority order ensures predictable behavior: users are guaranteed minimum representation of each person position, with temporal diversity applied when possible without compromising minimum guarantees.

#### 5.2.2. Person Grouping by Position
Persons are grouped by their `person_id` (determined by left-to-right ordering within frames):
- **person_0:** Leftmost person across all frames
- **person_1:** Second-from-left person across all frames  
- **person_2:** Third-from-left person across all frames
- **person_N:** Nth person position across all frames

This provides naive cross-frame person tracking that maintains API compatibility for future real person tracking implementations.

#### 5.2.3. Quality-First Selection Within Groups
For each person_id group, selection follows a **priority order** where minimum instance guarantees take precedence over temporal diversity constraints:

```python
def select_best_instances_for_person(person_candidates: List[PersonCandidate], criteria: PersonSelectionCriteria):
    # Sort by person.quality.overall_quality (highest first)
    person_candidates.sort(key=lambda p: p.person.quality.overall_quality, reverse=True)
    
    # Apply quality threshold filter
    qualified_candidates = [p for p in person_candidates if p.person.quality.overall_quality >= criteria.min_quality_threshold]
    
    # PRIORITY 1: Always satisfy minimum instances (ignore temporal diversity if needed)
    min_count = min(criteria.min_instances_per_person, len(qualified_candidates))
    if min_count == 0 and qualified_candidates:
        min_count = 1  # Always provide at least one instance if any exist
    
    guaranteed_selections = qualified_candidates[:min_count]
    remaining_candidates = qualified_candidates[min_count:]
    
    # PRIORITY 2: Apply temporal diversity to remaining selections up to maximum
    max_additional = criteria.max_instances_per_person - min_count
    if max_additional > 0 and remaining_candidates and criteria.temporal_diversity_threshold > 0:
        diverse_additional = apply_temporal_diversity_filter(
            remaining_candidates, criteria.temporal_diversity_threshold, guaranteed_selections
        )
        additional_selections = diverse_additional[:max_additional]
    else:
        additional_selections = remaining_candidates[:max_additional] if max_additional > 0 else []
    
    return guaranteed_selections + additional_selections

def apply_temporal_diversity_filter(candidates: List[PersonCandidate], min_seconds: float, guaranteed_selections: List[PersonCandidate]) -> List[PersonCandidate]:
    """Apply temporal diversity filter within a single person_id group.
    
    Args:
        candidates: Remaining candidates to filter for temporal diversity
        min_seconds: Minimum seconds between selected instances  
        guaranteed_selections: Already selected instances that must be considered for temporal diversity
    
    Returns:
        Temporally diverse candidates from the input list
    """
    if not candidates:
        return candidates
    
    # All previously selected instances (guaranteed + any diverse selections so far)
    all_selected = guaranteed_selections.copy()
    diverse_selections = []
    
    # Sort candidates by timestamp to process in temporal order
    sorted_candidates = sorted(candidates, key=lambda c: c.frame.source_info.video_timestamp)
    
    for candidate in sorted_candidates:
        # Check if this candidate is temporally diverse from all previously selected
        is_diverse = all(
            abs(candidate.frame.source_info.video_timestamp - selected.frame.source_info.video_timestamp) >= min_seconds
            for selected in all_selected
        )
        if is_diverse:
            diverse_selections.append(candidate)
            all_selected.append(candidate)  # Update for next iteration
    
    # Return in original quality order (preserve quality ranking from input)
    return [c for c in candidates if c in diverse_selections]
```

### 5.3. Implementation Details

#### 5.3.1. Selection Process Flow

**Step 1: Person Extraction and Grouping**
```python
def extract_and_group_persons(frames: List[FrameData]) -> Dict[int, List[PersonCandidate]]:
    person_groups = defaultdict(list)
    for frame in frames:
        for person in frame.get_persons():
            person_groups[person.person_id].append(PersonCandidate(frame, person))
    return person_groups
```

**Step 2: Quality-Based Selection Per Group**
```python
def select_persons(person_groups: Dict[int, List[PersonCandidate]], criteria: PersonSelectionCriteria) -> List[PersonSelection]:
    selected_persons = []
    for person_id, candidates in person_groups.items():
        best_instances = select_best_instances_for_person(candidates, criteria)
        for candidate in best_instances:
            selected_persons.append(PersonSelection(
                frame_data=candidate.frame,
                person_id=person_id,
                person=candidate.person,
                selection_score=candidate.person.quality.overall_quality
            ))
    return selected_persons
```

**Step 3: Output Format Handling**
```python
def handle_output_deduplication(selected_persons: List[PersonSelection], output_format: str):
    if output_format == "full_frames":
        # Keep only highest quality person per frame
        frame_to_best_person = {}
        for person_selection in selected_persons:
            frame_id = person_selection.frame_data.frame_id
            if (frame_id not in frame_to_best_person or 
                person_selection.selection_score > frame_to_best_person[frame_id].selection_score):
                frame_to_best_person[frame_id] = person_selection
        return list(frame_to_best_person.values())
    else:  # crops
        return selected_persons  # Allow multiple persons per frame
```

## 7. Risk Assessment

### 7.1. Potential Issues

- **Incorrect Pairings:** The spatial association heuristic may fail in complex scenes with heavy occlusion or unusual poses (e.g., a person bending over, causing their face to be distant from their torso's bounding box center).
- **Quality Score Inaccuracy:** Quality assessment on very small or low-resolution face/body crops may produce unreliable scores, potentially impacting frame selection.
- [x] **Serialization Complexity:** Person objects contain complex nested data (faces, bodies, quality) that must serialize correctly for pipeline resumability. ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Selection Bias:** Diversity algorithm may over-compensate for multi-person frames, leading to selection of poor-quality multi-person content over high-quality single-person content.
- **Configuration Complexity:** Multiple tunable parameters for diversity selection may be difficult to optimize across different video types.
- **Upstream/Downstream Integration:** Other system components not explicitly listed as "affected" may have implicit dependencies on the old data schema.

### 7.2. Mitigation Strategies

- **Verbose Logging & Debugging:** Introduce a verbosity flag that, when enabled, logs detailed information about each association decision, including distances and chosen heuristics. This will allow for visual debugging of pairings.
- **Minimum Bounding Box Size:** Implement a minimum pixel area check for body and face crops before running quality assessment. If a crop is too small, assign a default low-quality score instead of relying on potentially noisy results.
- **Diversity Parameter Validation:** Implement bounds checking and validation for all diversity configuration parameters, with sensible defaults and warnings for extreme values.
- **Quality Floor Enforcement:** Establish absolute minimum quality thresholds that cannot be overridden by diversity bonuses, preventing selection of truly poor-quality content.
- **Incremental Integration & CI:** Merge changes through a series of smaller, well-tested pull requests. Rely on the comprehensive CI test matrix to catch any regressions or unexpected downstream breakages early.
- **Comprehensive Serialization Testing:** Unit tests for Person serialization/deserialization with edge cases
- **State Validation:** Pipeline state validation to ensure Person objects are correctly persisted

## Appendix A: Current System Analysis

This appendix provides a formal summary of the current system's capabilities regarding pose detection and association.

### A.1. Pose Data Coverage

**Status: Comprehensive**

The `FrameData` object successfully captures complete head and body pose information for all detected individuals.

- **Body Pose (`pose_detections`):** Includes 17 COCO keypoints covering the full body, a bounding box for each person, and confidence scores for each keypoint.
- **Head Pose (`head_poses`):** Includes 3D orientation angles (yaw, pitch, roll), 9 cardinal direction classifications, and associated confidence scores.

### A.2. Association Implementation Analysis

- **Face-to-Head Association**
  - **Method:** Direct indexing via the `HeadPoseResult.face_id` field.
  - **Reliability:** High. This is an explicit and robust linking mechanism.
  - **Status:** Functions correctly in all tested scenarios.

- **Face-to-Body Association**
  - **Method:** Implicit indexing (`face_detections[i]` is assumed to map to `pose_detections[i]`).
  - **Reliability:** Low, especially in multi-person contexts.
  - **Status:** Prone to failure. This approach breaks when detection counts for faces and bodies differ or when detection order is not consistent.

### A.3. System Capability Summary

| Scenario        | Face Detection | Body Pose    | Head Pose    | Face/Body Association | Overall System State |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Single Person** | ✅ Excellent   | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Reliable           | ✅ **Works Well**      |
| **Multi-Person**  | ✅ Excellent   | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Unreliable         | ⚠️ **Problematic**     |

### A.4. Key Limitations Identified

1.  **Index-Order Dependency:** The current system's reliance on detection order for association is fragile.
2.  **Lack of Spatial Verification:** No geometric checks are performed to validate that a face and body belong to the same individual.
3.  **No Identity Persistence:** Person identity is not maintained across frames, making tracking impossible.
4.  **Inconsistent Detection Order:** Different underlying detection models may return results in different, unpredictable orders.
